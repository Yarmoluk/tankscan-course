## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive education in wireless tank monitoring systems, using TankScan's technology as the primary reference platform. Students will progress from foundational concepts in sensor physics and wireless communication through practical deployment and data analytics, culminating in advanced topics like predictive maintenance, AI integration, and the future of connected industrial assets.

The curriculum is organized around three pillars:

1. **Technology** - How wireless tank monitors work (sensors, communication, cloud platforms)
2. **Application** - How to deploy, manage, and optimize monitoring systems across industries
3. **Innovation** - How data analytics, AI, and emerging technologies are transforming asset management
