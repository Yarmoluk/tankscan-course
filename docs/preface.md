# Preface

## For Craig Truempi

---

Dear Craig,

This intelligent textbook is both a tribute to your work at TankScan and a demonstration of what is now possible at the intersection of industrial technology and artificial intelligence.

When you took ownership of TankScan through ITEK, LLC, you inherited more than a product line of wireless tank monitors. You took stewardship of an idea that began in 2003 when manual tank checks were the norm: that remote, wireless monitoring could transform how industries manage their most critical liquid assets. From fuel distributors to chemical manufacturers, from c-store operators to oil field service companies, TankScan has proven that idea right, improving fleet efficiencies by 30% and turning raw sensor data into smart business decisions.

This textbook captures that story and that technology in a new way.

## The Intelligent Textbook Pipeline

What you are reading was created through a systematic AI-driven process that represents the future of technical education:

### Step 1: Site Research and Domain Analysis
We began by analyzing TankScan's technology, products, and market position. Every product from the TSR Cellular Monitor to the TSU Ultrasonic Monitor, every solution from tank farms to underground storage, and every industry from petroleum to specialty chemicals was catalogued and understood.

### Step 2: Course Description
From this research, a structured course description was generated with clear learning objectives, target audience, prerequisites, and a topic outline spanning 15 chapters. This is not a marketing document. It is a curriculum designed to teach someone everything they need to know about wireless tank monitoring.

### Step 3: Bloom's Taxonomy Alignment
Every learning outcome in this textbook is aligned to Benjamin Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. This means the textbook deliberately progresses from foundational knowledge (remembering and understanding) through application and analysis, to the highest cognitive levels of evaluation and creation. A student who completes this textbook will not just know about tank monitoring. They will be able to design, deploy, optimize, and innovate within the field.

### Step 4: Learning Graph and Concept Dependencies
A learning graph of interconnected concepts was generated, mapping the dependencies between ideas. You cannot understand radar measurement without first understanding electromagnetic waves. You cannot optimize delivery routes without understanding data analytics. The learning graph ensures that concepts are taught in the right order, building knowledge systematically.

### Step 5: Full Text Generation
Each chapter was then generated as complete educational content with explanations, diagrams, real-world examples, and review questions. The content is written at a technical professional level while remaining accessible to anyone with basic technical literacy.

### Step 6: Interactive Chatbot
Finally, all of this content was used to create an AI-powered chatbot that can answer any question about TankScan, wireless tank monitoring, or the technologies covered in this textbook. This chatbot can be shared with your team, your customers, or anyone who wants to learn about your technology.

## Why This Matters

Craig, this exercise demonstrates something powerful: the ability to take a company's domain expertise, encoded in its products and solutions, and transform it into structured educational content that can be shared, studied, and interacted with.

Imagine giving every new employee an intelligent textbook that knows everything about TankScan. Imagine giving every customer a chatbot that can answer their technical questions instantly. Imagine giving every partner a learning resource that helps them understand not just what TankScan does, but why it works.

That is what this textbook represents.

Thank you for your pioneering work in wireless tank monitoring. This textbook is a small reflection of the large impact TankScan has made.
